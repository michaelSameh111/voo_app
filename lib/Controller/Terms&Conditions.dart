is the intent of the parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances, arbitration proceedings will
be concluded within ninety (90) days from the date the arbitrator is appointed. The arbitrator may
extend this time limit in the interests of justice. Failure to adhere to this time limit shall not
constitute a basis for challenging the award.

content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written consent of all parties. The
Parties shall be entitled to discovery in the arbitration in that any Party shall be entitled to request
no more than 1000 pages of documents and take up no more than 32 hours of depositions. Any

witness who will testify at the arbitration, with a summary of the anticipated testimony of such
witness ten (10) days before the arbitration hearing. The selected arbitrator shall have no authority

of this Section by bringing suit in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties agree that the
arbitrator shall have authority to grant injunctive or other forms of equitable relief to any party.

its own proportionate share of arbitrator fees and expenses [plus the fees and expenses of the
arbitrator designated and the arbitration fees and expenses of the American Arbitration Association.
The arbitrator shall be entitled to award the foregoing arbitration and administrative fees and
expenses as damages in his/her discretion. The selected arbitrator, shall have exclusive authority
to resolve any dispute arising out of or relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability,
or formation of this Arbitration Agreement, including without limitation any claim that all or any
part of this Arbitration Agreement is void or voidable, rather than any federal, state, or local court
or agency. The selected arbitrator shall also have exclusive authority to resolve all threshold
arbitrability issues, including issues relating to whether the Terms are applicable, unconscionable,
or illusory and any defense to arbitration, including without limitation waiver, delay, laches, or
estoppel. However, only a court of competent jurisdiction, and not an arbitrator, shall have the
exclusive authority to resolve any and all disputes arising out of or relating to the Class Action
Waiver, including, but not limited to, any claim that all or part of the Class Action Waiver is
unenforceable, unconscionable, illegal, void, or voidable. The parties agree to also meet and
negotiate in good faith in order to resolve any disputes which may arise between them. This
Arbitration Agreement survives after your relationship with VOO, LLC ends.
Voluntary Pre-Arbitration Negotiation Provision:
Before initiating any arbitration or proceeding, you and VOO, LLC may agree to first attempt to
negotiate any dispute, claim or controversy between the parties informally for 30 days, unless this
time period is mutually extended by you and VOO, LLC. A party who intends to seek negotiation
under this subsection must first send to the other a written notice of the dispute (“Notice”). The
Notice must (1) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (2) set forth the specific
relief sought. All offers, promises, conduct and statements, whether oral or written, made in the
course of the negotiation by any of the parties, their agents, employees, and attorneys are
confidential, privileged and inadmissible for any purpose, including as evidence of liability or for
impeachment, in arbitration or other proceeding involving the parties, provided that evidence that
is otherwise admissible or discoverable shall not be rendered inadmissible or non-discoverable as
a result of its use in the negotiation.
Disputes Covered By This Arbitration Agreement:
By signing this agreement, you acknowledge, affirm, and agree to be bound by individual
arbitration from disputes, claims, or controversies arising from or relating to the existence, breach,
termination, enforcement, interpretation, scope, waiver, or validity of this agreement and prior
versions. This includes the following:
• Disputes regarding your access to or use of the VOO Application and Platform at any time.

as related to the VOO Application and Platform
Class Action Waiver:
The parties agree to resolve any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a
class or collective action basis (“Class Action Waiver”). The arbitrator shall have no authority to
consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis, and
shall not do so on a class or collective action basis. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Section or the AAA Rules, disputes regarding the enforceability, revocability, or validity of this
Class Action Waiver may be resolved only by a civil court of competent jurisdiction.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, in any case in which: (1) the dispute is
filed as a class or collective action; and (2) there is a final judicial determination that all or part of
the Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, the class and/or collective action to that extent must be
litigated in a civil court of competent jurisdiction, but the portion of the Class Action Waiver that
is enforceable shall be enforced in arbitration. Except as otherwise provided above, the parties
hereby waive trial in a court of law or by jury. All other rights, remedies, statutes of limitation and
defenses applicable to claims asserted in a court of law will apply in the arbitration. The parties
also expressly waive the right to seek, recover, or obtain any non-individual relief.
Notwithstanding anything else in this agreement, this Class Action Waiver does not prevent you
or VOO, LLC from participating in a class-wide, collective, and/or representative settlement
of claims.
The parties also expressly waive the right to seek, recover, or obtain any non-individual relief
including, but is not limited to, instances in which you or VOO, LLC are represented by a law firm
or collection of law firms that has filed 50 or more arbitration demands of a substantially similar
nature against the other party within 180 days of the arbitration demand filed on your or VOO,
LLC’s behalf, and the law firm or collection of law firms seeks to simultaneously or collectively
administer and/or arbitrate all the arbitration demands in the aggregate. Notwithstanding anything
else in this agreement, this Waiver does not prevent you or VOO, LLC from participating in a
mass settlement of claims.
The parties further agree that if for any reason a claim does not proceed in arbitration, this Class
Action Waiver shall remain in effect, and a court may not preside over any action joining,
coordinating, or consolidating the claims of multiple individuals against VOO, LLC in a single
proceeding, except that this Class Action Waiver shall not prevent you or VOO, LLC from
participating in a class-wide, collective, and/or representative settlement of claims. If there is a
final judicial determination that any portion of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable or
unlawful for any reason, (i) any class, collective, coordinated, consolidated, and/or representative
claims subject to the unenforceable or unlawful portion(s) shall proceed in a court of competent
jurisdiction; (ii) the portion of the Class Action Waiver that is enforceable shall be enforced in
arbitration; (iii) the unenforceable or unlawful portion(s) shall be severed from this Arbitration
Agreement; and (iv) severance of the unenforceable or unlawful portion(s) shall have no impact
whatsoever on the enforceability, applicability, or validity of the Arbitration Agreement or the
arbitrability of any remaining claims asserted by you or VOO, LLC.
Disputes Not Requiring Arbitration:
The following claims do not require that the parties initiate arbitration if and only said claims are
brought on an individual basisin thatsuch claims are not brought as a class, collective, coordinated,
consolidated, mass and/or representative action, or other kind of group, multi-plaintiff or joint
action, brought by you or joined by you in any fashion with any other proceeding against VOO,
LLC:
• Individual claims brought in small claims court so long as the matter remains in such court
and advances only on an individual basis;
• Individual claims requesting injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation
of a party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual
property rights.
The parties’ agreement not to require arbitration in these limited instances does not waive the
enforceability of this Arbitration Agreement as to any other provision (including, but not limited
to, the waivers provided for in this Section, which will continue to apply in court as well as in
arbitration), or the enforceability of this agreement as to any other controversy, claim, or dispute.
Arbitration Process Rules and Procedures:
Any party wishing to initiate arbitration following the conclusion of the voluntary negotiation
process must provide the other party with a written demand for arbitration and file the demand
with an applicable arbitration provider. A party initiating an arbitration against VOO, LLC must
send the written demand for arbitration to VOO, LLC at TBD address or serve the Demand on
VOO, LLC’s registered agent for service of process, c/o VOO, LLC (the name and current contact
information for the registered agent in each state are available online here). Additionally, a party
initiating arbitration against VOO, LLC must send an electronic version of the demand for
arbitration to the applicable arbitration provider, and must send an electronic version of the asfiled demand to arbitration@VOOLLC.com.
Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, arbitration will be conducted in the county where the
filing party resides. Your right to a hearing will be determined by the applicable arbitration
provider’s rules. Subject to the applicable arbitration provider’s rules, the Arbitrator will have the
discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with the
expedited nature of the arbitration. Any party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party
to allow judgment on specified terms as long as the offer is served at least 10 days before the date
set for the arbitration hearing. If the other party accepts the offer, then the offer shall be submitted
to the arbitrator with proof of acceptance, who shall enter judgment accordingly. If the offer is not
accepted prior to the arbitration hearing or within 30 days after it is made, whichever occurs first,
it shall be deemed withdrawn, and inadmissible as evidence in further arbitration proceedings.
The Arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the applicable arbitration
provider’s rules. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent
jurisdiction. The Arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the claimant
and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant’s individual claim. An
Arbitrator’s decision shall be final and binding on all parties.
The Arbitrator is not bound by decisions reached in separate arbitrations, and the Arbitrator’s
decision shall be binding only upon the parties to the arbitration that are the subject of the decision.
The Arbitrator shall award reasonable costs incurred in the arbitration to the prevailing party in
accordance with the law(s) of the state in which arbitration is held.
Any and all disputes regarding a party’s obligation to pay any arbitration fees or costs that arise
after an arbitrator is appointed shall be determined solely by the arbitrator. If such a dispute arises
before an arbitrator has been appointed, a court of competent jurisdiction in connection with the
applicable arbitration provider will determine the apportionment of fees and costs.
If any portion of this Arbitration Agreement is found to be unenforceable or unlawful for any
reason the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall be severed from this agreement and severance
of the unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever on the remainder of
this agreement or the parties’ ability to compel arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual
basis pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement.

time. VOO, LLC will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided
that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness
of such Charges or the amounts thereof. Certain users may from time to time receive promotional
offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services
or goods obtained through the use of the VOO Application and Platform, and you agree that such
promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your
use of the VOO Application and Platform or the Charges applied to you. Promotional offers and
discounts are subject to change or withdrawal at any time and without notice. You may elect to
cancel your request for VOO Application and Platform at any time prior to the commencement of
such VOO Application and Platform, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee on a
Third-Party Provider’s behalf.
With respect to Third-Party Providers, Charges you incur will be owed directly to Third-Party
Providers, and VOO, LLC will collect payment of those charges from you, on the Third-Party
Provider’s behalf as their limited payment collection agent, and payment of the Charges shall be
considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third-Party Provider. In such cases,
you retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third-Party Provider for services or goods
received by you from such Third-Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods,
and Charges you incur will be owed to the Third-Party Provider. VOO, LLC will consider in good
faith any request from a Third-Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or
good. This payment structure is intended to fully compensate a Third-Party Provider, if applicable,
for the services or goods obtained in connection with your use of the VOO Application and
Platform. Except for amounts provided by you through the Application as part of the “tip” feature,
VOO, LLC does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to a Third-Party
Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a
gratuity to any Third-Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through
the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. There also may be certain Charges you incur that
will be owed and paid directly to VOO, LLC or its affiliates. For the avoidance of doubt, VOO,
LLC does not charge a fee for a user to access the VOO, LLC Marketplace Platform, but may

Application and Platform may differ from the prices offered or published by Third-Party Providers
for the same product or menu items and/or from prices available at other third-party

Application and Platform may not be the lowest prices at which the product or menu items are
sold. You also understand that product or menu item prices displayed through the VOO
Application and Platform or fees charged by and paid to VOO, LLC may vary based on whether
you choose to pick up your order or have it delivered.
If you think a correction should be made to any Charge you incurred, you must let VOO, LLC
know in writing within 30 days after the Charge took place or VOO, LLC will have no further
responsibility and you waive your right to later dispute the amounts charged.
Damage, Cleaning, Lost and Found, and Violation of Terms:
VOO, LLC may charge you a fee on behalf of Third-Party Providers if, during your use of the
VOO Application and Platform, you have caused damage to a vehicle or property that requires
repair or cleaning (“Repair” or “Cleaning”). The amount of such fee shall be determined, in VOO,
LLC’s sole discretion, based on the type of damage and the severity. VOO, LLC reserves the right
to verify or otherwise require documentation of damages prior to processing a fee. In the event
that a Repair or Cleaning request is verified by VOO, LLC in VOO, LLC’s reasonable discretion,
VOO, LLC reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or
Cleaning using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts, as well as those
pertaining to lost and found goods, will be transferred by VOO, LLC to a Third-Party Provider, if
applicable, and are non-refundable.
Additionally, if you fail to comply with this agreement, you may be responsible for Charges,
including without limitation, for transactions that could not be completed properly, arising out of

SECURITY OF YOUR INFORMATION
VOO LLC takes the security of its users as the highest priority and applies robust security 
measures to insure data protection and the safety of your personal information. 
Unfortunately, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and no method of data 
transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse, but we 
have taken every step to secure the personal information you provide to us. That being 
said please bear in mind that any information disclosed online is vulnerable to 
interception and misuse by unauthorized parties. Therefore, we cannot guarantee 
complete security if you provide personal information.
CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES : 
Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems [and our mobile applications] 
include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy 
preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. 
No uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been 
finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other 
mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a 
standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform 
you about that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Policy.

In-app ratings pages
After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An 
average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users 
for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers 
from whom they request transport, and driver ratings are available to their riders.
This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps 
create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.
Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the VOO LLC app, and also access 
a breakdown of their average rating in VOO LLC’s Privacy Centre.
Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in the VOO LLC Driver 
app.
Delivery persons may also be rated by order recipients, restaurants and merchants.
